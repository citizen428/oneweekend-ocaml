# Ray Tracing in Ocaml

I've been interested in [Ocaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) since about 2009, but never really got past dabbling. I also recently found out about Peter Shirley's excellent book series on ray tracers, written in C++:

- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend)
- [Ray Tracing: the Next Week](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracingthenextweek)
- [Ray Tracing: The Rest Of Your Life](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracingtherestofyourlife)

So I figured: Why not combine the two and write something I've never done before in a language I barely know?

## Who is this for?

Mostly myself. It may be of slight interest if you want to see how a ray tracer can be written in (bad) Ocaml and I'd be more than grateful for any suggestions regarding coding style etc.
